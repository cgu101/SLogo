##Estimation: before looking at the old code:
-  how long do you think it will take you to complete this new feature?
1 hour
-  how many files will you need to add or update? Why?
2~3 files, because all parser need to do is in 2~3 files.

##Review: after completing the feature:
-  how long did it take you to complete this new feature?
0.5 hour
-  did you get it completely right on the first try?
No. Actually I missed the parts in the enumerator.
- how many files did you need to add or update? Why?
3, they are nodes package, parser and factory separately.

##Analysis: what do you feel this exercise reveals about your project's design and documentation?
- was it as good (or bad) as you remembered?
Yes! I think it is still good to use for now. 
- what could be improved?
Yes! We can use composition to do the control logic of the control structure nodes.
- what would it have been like if you were not familiar with the code at all?
I'm not familiar with front end code at all. However I can provide well-defined API for them and I think that's enough.
