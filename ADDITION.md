Estimation:
------------
I think it will take 30 to 45 minutes to complete this new feature. I would need to add one file and update 2 files. I would have to a add file to get a new view and would need to update the Main class to call this new class as well as need to update classes related to turtle group and or SlogoView.

Review:
--------
It took about an hour to implement the feature. However, I just had to add one file and update one file. I could't get it right in the first try and it is still not completely implemented. I get the image to appear in the new status view and I am able to click and update the status view with new image. I am sure that I have sent the image to the main GUI screen and the method in TurtlegroupObserver class gets the screen but it doesnt set it to the GUI. I am not aware about the observer-observable part that updates the GUI, so I couldn't make the new image appear in the SLogo view when I upload a new image by clicking the image in the status view.

Analysis: 
---------
The design was ok but the documentation was not that good as I couldn't myself figure out the way to update the main GUI screen using the observer and observable. The updating part could be made much simpler. I remember that it was easy when there was only one turtle but when we implemented multiple turtles, I didn't work on the observer and observable part of the code. So, I couldn't figure it out. If I was not familiar with the code, then it would have been really difficult to understand which methods to call.
