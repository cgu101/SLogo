###Design Issues
- Business Logic in the front End??
  + The front end is checking to see if the ***pen is up or down*** before drawing the line.
  + The front end is checking to see if the ***clearScreen*** is true before updating the view.
  + Should the logic be pushed into the FrontEndObserver or should it all happen in the backend
